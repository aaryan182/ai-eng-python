A 3-agent autonomous system:

User Text 
↓
Extraction Agent (uses tools to extract info)
↓
Validation Agent (fixes missing/wrong fields)
↓
Formatting Agent (returns perfect JSON)
↓
Final Output


This is how modern AI systems operate




AGENT ARCHITECTURE

1) Agent State : 
Dictionary Storing: 
{
    "name": None,
    "age": None,
    "skills": [],
    "domain": None
}

2) ReAct Loop
Each loop:
LLM produces a thought, LLM chooses an Action(tool_call), Tool is executed, Observation is added to memory, Loop continues

3) Validation Layer
Checks if : Name extracted? , age validated? , Skills non - empty?
If something missing -> loop again

4) Multi agent chain
Final Formatting by as second LLM ensures Perfect JSON

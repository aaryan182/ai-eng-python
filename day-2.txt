OOP(Object Oriented Programming) in python

Agents = Objects
Tools = Methods
LLM Pipelines = Classes
LangGraph Nodes = Encapsulated Behavior


OOP => Think of a class as a blueprint and an object as a real thing built from that blueprint

Class => defines structure + Behavior
Object => actually performs actions


class Person:
    pass

then object creation
p = Person()


Constructors (__init__)

this runs when an object is created 

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

p = Person("Aaryan",22)
print(p.name)
print(p.age)


self represents the object itself

p = Person("aar",22)
self.name = "aar"
self.age = 22
this allows each object to have its own data


Methods = functions inside a class

class Person:
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello"

p = Person()
print(p.greet())


Methods using Object data
Just like an agent using its memory

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, I am {self.name}"

p = Person("AAr)
print(p.greet())


Encapsulation (protecting data)
hide data inside Objects

prefix with _

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self._balance = balance   // private attribute
    
    def deposit(self,amount):
        self._balance += amount
    
    def get_balance(self):
        return slef._balance


Inheritance - Reusing Behavior

Base Agent -> specialized agent inherits

class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        return "Unknown"
    
class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"
    
class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow"


Polymorphism - same method , different Behavior

def makes_sound(animal):
    print(animal.sound())

makes_sound(Dog()) # Bark
makes_sound(Cat()) # Meow


Class methods & Static Methods
works with class, not object

class User:
    count = 0

    @classmethod
    def increment_count(cls):
        cls.count += 1
    

Static Methods(utility)
Doesn't use class or object

class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a,b):
        return a + b
